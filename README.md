# Context

This app is made with React Native, coupled with some extra nice packages to handle routing, dataflow and UI elements.

## Main technologies used

- [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)

- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)

> Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. In this app I am using Redux Toolkit.

- React Navigation (https://reactnavigation.org/)

> Rect navigation library version v5.x

## Troubleshooting

**Note:** Each time you pull commits from others, run the **yarn** command to install dependencies that may have been introduced.

### react-native is not recognized as an internal or external command
- If your terminal is telling you react-native is not known, try to install it globally with npm: ```npm install -g react-native-cli``` and re-run the above command.

### 'adb' is not recognized as an internal or external command

If you have a build error with this message on Windows, it means that you must add the Android sdk platform tools to your environment PATH.

My value on windows: *```C:\Users\Manuel\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\platform-tools```*

### failed to find target with hash string 'android-23'

React Native needs this to be installed in order to work, and the default target installed by *Android Studio* is the 24th. To solve this issue, open android studio and click on SDK Manager Icon:

![SDK Manager](https://i.snag.gy/bxQd0z.jpg)

Then click on the line with API Level of value 23 and apply.

### failed to find Build Tools revision *XX.X.X*

It seems you are missing the build tools at specific revision *XX.X.X*, so you need to install them. Go to Android Studio SDK Settings (see images above) and click on the SDK Tools snippet.

Then, click on **Show Package Details** and look for Android SDK Build Tools *XX.X.X*. Then check if it is installed. If not, install it and this issue should be solved then.

### Execution failed for task ':app:dexDebug'

Go into the **android** project's folder in your terminal and run

*Windows*
```
gradlew clean
```

*Linux & Mac*
```
./gradlew clean
```

Then delete the build folder, go back to the project's root folder and try again, this error should be solved.

> **Note:** If it doesn't work as expected, try checking you have not forgotten any of the steps above. If not, please **open an issue and describe your problem**.

## Contributing to the project

Since the linting is done through [**eslint**](http://eslint.org/), you will need to configure your text editor to use the coding rules defined in the *.eslint.js* project file.

> A code that contains unjustified errors won't be merged to the master branch.
